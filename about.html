        <p>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering at G.C.E,Keonjhar was established in 2015 and is renowned for imparting state of the art undergraduate education and preparing its students for solving real world challenges. Computer Science is the systematic study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and of practical techniques for their implementation and application in computer systems.</p><p> Computer scientists invent algorithmic processes that create, describe, and transform information and formulate suitable abstractions to model complex systems. The study is devoted to theoretical foundations of computation and practical techniques for their implementation in computer systems. Loosely, Computer Science focuses on software, and Computer Engineering emphasizes hardware.</p><p> However, there exists a significant overlap between them. In its entirety, Computer Science and Engineering can be conceived as the two sides of the same coin, where each side complements the other. Apart from the regular courses, the department also conducts workshops, training programs and conferences to provide best technical skills and software engineering ethics.</p>

<h3><u><b>Programs Objectives</b></u></h3>
<h5><b>Robust Undergraduate Program</b></h5>
<ul>
  <li><p>The undergraduate curriculum provides a strong foundation in all areas of computer science.</p></li>
  <li><p>The recently revised curriculum has reduced course load and greater emphasis on design and project work. It emphasizes the need for independent thinking and encourages students to get involved in interesting and novel projects.</p></li>
  <li><p>In addition to the course projects, a typical undergraduate student does four projects during his/her stay.</p></li>
  <li><p>The department has the facilities for carrying out projects in Computer Graphics,ComputerVision,Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, I.O.T,Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Image Processing etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Faculty Student Interaction</b></h5>
<p>The students interact freely with faculty on all matters related to studies. The curriculum gives them ample opportunity to work in close cooperation with any faculty member. Students are free to approach faculty for short term (a summer or a semester) project or long term projects.</p>
<h5><b>Focus onReal World Problem solving skills</b></h5>
<p>We are focusing on the real world problem solving skill of a student. We assign each students with a real world problem of his own choice which is given at the starting of each semester & he/she has to submit the solution to the problem by using any of the computer science involved methods.</p>
<h5><b>Special Features of the Department </b></h5>
<p>The Students are imparted with cutting-edge technology, training and hands-on experience on live projects to meet the requirements of new age industries. The students are encouraged to participate in the global project competitions and also encouraged to publish their research work in national and international Journals/ Conferences. Students have participated and won many programming and modelling contests across the country. Students are participating and winners in Infosys Aspiration 2020, IBM TGMC, IIT/NIT tech fest, Google Summer of Code,Kagglecompetetions,TCS coding contest etc.</p>

<h5><b>Areas of the Department which is good for Placement Purpose</b></h5>
<ul>
  <li>Programming Skills : (C, C++, Java& Advanced Java,Matlab)</li>
  <li>Problem Solving Approaches : (Data Structure and Algorithms)</li>
  <li>Front End Development skills : (HTML5,JavaScript,CSS3)</li>
  <li>Back End Development skills : (SQL e.g. Oracle ,NoSQL e.g. MongoDB)</li>
  <li>Machine Learning &Data Science skills: (Python, R ,Big Data Analysis e.g. Hadoop )</li>
  <li>Cloud Computing</li>
   <li>Internet Of Things</li>
</ul>

<h3><b><u>Laboratory</u></b></h3>
<p>The department has the following well-equipped laboratories to cater to the needs of the undergraduate programmes.</p>
<ul>
